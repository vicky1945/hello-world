A sidecar is an additional container that runs alongside the main application container in the same Kubernetes pod. Sidecars can share storage and network resources with the main container, making them useful for supporting or enhancing the primary container's functionality without interfering with its core operations. Sidecars are often used for logging, monitoring, or configuration syncing.
Example of a Sidecar in a JMeter Deployment
Let’s say you have a JMeter deployment, and you want each pod to write logs to a centralized storage location without modifying the JMeter container’s configuration directly. You can add a sidecar container that continuously copies or syncs the logs from the JMeter container to shared storage.
Here’s an example of how this works:

Use Case: Adding a Sidecar to Collect and Store JMeter Logs

Let’s modify the JMeter deployment to include a sidecar container that will periodically check for logs generated by JMeter and copy them to a shared persistent volume.
Step 1: Define Shared Storage

Define a PersistentVolumeClaim that both the main JMeter container and the sidecar container can access. This will allow them to share files within the pod.
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: shared-logs-pvc
  namespace: bankingservices-sit
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi

Step 2: Add Sidecar to the JMeter Deployment

In the JMeter deployment, add a second container (sidecar) that copies logs from the main container’s log directory to a shared storage location.
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: test-jmeter-deployment
  namespace: bankingservices-sit
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: jmeter
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: jmeter
    spec:
      containers:
        # Main JMeter container
        - name: jmeter
          image: sahabimgrepo.emiratesnbd.com:5000/git-jm-v1.2:v1
          args:
            - |
              jmeter -n -t /tests/test.jmx -l /logs/results.jtl
          volumeMounts:
            - name: shared-logs
              mountPath: /logs  # Shared storage for logs

        # Sidecar container to handle log management
        - name: log-sidecar
          image: busybox  # Minimal container for file management
          args:
            - /bin/sh
            - '-c'
            - |
              while true; do
                cp /logs/results.jtl /shared-logs/results_$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)_$HOSTNAME.jtl
                sleep 60  # Repeat every 60 seconds
              done
          volumeMounts:
            - name: shared-logs
              mountPath: /logs  # Mount same volume for shared access

      volumes:
        - name: shared-logs
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: shared-logs-pvc



Explanation of the Example
Main Container (JMeter): The jmeter container runs the performance test and writes the test results (results.jtl) to /logs, which is the mounted shared volume.
Sidecar Container: The log-sidecar container periodically checks /logs for new logs, copying or syncing them to a centralized directory (/shared-logs) on the shared volume. This allows for regular backups or exports of logs without modifying JMeter.
Shared Volume: Both containers access /logs via shared-logs-pvc, ensuring that logs are available to both containers in the same pod.
Benefits of Using a Sidecar in This Example
Decoupling of Concerns: The sidecar handles log management independently, leaving the JMeter container to focus solely on running tests.
Centralized Storage: By using shared storage, logs from each JMeter instance can be stored centrally, simplifying log aggregation and analysis.
Flexibility: The sidecar container can be customized or replaced without modifying the main JMeter container’s setup.
Other Sidecar Use Cases
Sidecars are commonly used in microservices applications for:

Proxying traffic (e.g., Envoy or Istio sidecars)
Log aggregation
Metrics collection (e.g., Prometheus exporter as a sidecar)
Configuration syncing (e.g., syncing files from an external configuration server)
The sidecar pattern offers modularity and ease of management in complex applications, especially in Kubernetes where multiple containers in a pod can share resources easily.
